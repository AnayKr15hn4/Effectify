## 💡 Pro Tips
- **Responsive Design**: When building in the Studio, try to make your effects responsive so they look great on all screen sizes.
- **Safe IDs**: Avoid using weird symbols in your titles; the Studio will try to clean them up, but "Simple & Clean" titles make the best URLs!

Happy Creating! 🚀🕺
